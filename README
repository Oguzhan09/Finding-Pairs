In this project, we implement a “Find the pair” game using C++ and Qt. In our game,
cards are illustrated by push buttons which have letters on each of them. “X” represents the
back of the card. All cards have another letter. The same letter is placed on exactly two cards.
Every time the game is reset, letters are distributed randomly.

When a button is pressed, it will be disabled, and its letter will appear. When the sec-
ond button is pressed, it will be checked whether the letter of current pressed button is the
same as the previous pressed button. If so, their letters will disappear, and they will be no
longer enabled. Also, the number of pairs and the number of tries on the top is incremented. If
the letters of the two buttons are not the same, “X” will appear in place of the letters. They
will again be enabled. Not the number of pairs but the number of tries will be incremented.

When two cards are open, the user should not be able to click another button. To
achieve this purpose, all buttons will be disabled when two cards are open for a second. After
waiting one second, buttons that should be enabled will be enabled.

If the user presses the “Reset” button, the game will be reset. That is, all letters will be
distributed randomly, number of pairs and tries will be zero, all buttons will be enabled, and
all letters will be “X”. The “Reset” button can be pressed whenever the user wants.

When all pairs are found, the game should finish. So, if the number of pairs is twelve,
the game will end, and “YOU FIND ALL THE PAIRS AFTER # TRIES” will appear in the
middle of the screen. Here “#” is the number of tries.
